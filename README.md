This repository contains code for a project for IS 3020. This project is entitled GameOn! 

It consists of several casual games that the user can play. 

These games are Hangman, Number Guessing, Rock Paper Scissors, and Mastermind.

Hangman
> Word-guessing game with limited tries

> The program tells the user when they guess the letters in the word correctly and in which spot they are placed

> The program also has different categories of words to guess from and different difficulty levels

Number Guessing
>The program picks a random number in a specific range that the user will then try and guess in limited turns

>The program tells the user whether their guess is higher or lower than the actual number

Rock, Paper, Scissors
> User plays against the computer

>The program randomly picks one of the three choices each turn

> Best two out of three

Mastermind
>Number-guessing game

>Number is a preset length, and the program tells the user when they have guessed the digits in the correct position in the number

>Hard mode in which the program only tells the user how many numbers are correct, but not where the numbers are in the digit
